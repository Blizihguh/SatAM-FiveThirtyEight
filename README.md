## Why?

## How?

I recommend using Tampermonkey [(Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) [(Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), since that's what I tested it on, although it should work with Scriptish or Greasemonkey as well. Once you've installed Tampermonkey (or whichever userscript manager you prefer), [you can install the script by clicking here](https://github.com/Blizihguh/SatAM-FiveThirtyEight/raw/master/SatAM%20Fivey.user.js).
